# The Valley

A macOS adaptation of a ground-breaking real-time RPG from 1982

## History ##

The Valley was a type-in-yourself program published in the UK in Computing Today magazine’s April 1982 issue. I didn’t key it in but some other lad did, so I got to play it on the school’s Research Machines 380Z. The listing was guarded jealously, but I was able to borrow it, make a photocopy and, eventually, port it to the Dragon 32.

I wrote about in my ‘Forgotten Tech’ column in The Register, back in 2009. You can read the article [here](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/27/back_into_the_valley/). The [comments section](https://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/1/2009/11/27/back_into_the_valley/) is particularly illuminting.
